# Genetic Learning with Tensorflow
## This application was made with PyGame and Tensorflow, and is my first attempt at genetic learning with no prior knowledge.
## I made a class called Bug that acted as the "organism". The goal was to find the most optimal path to a dot on the screen. Each bug has it's own brain (neural network) that receives the distance from the dot as input, and outputs an action (Left, Right, Down, or Up). Each generation would have multiple bugs attempt the challenge, and would pick the best bugs to "reproduce" to the next generation. Over time they would get better and better until the figured out the solution. This is definetely not the most optimal way to do this, but like I said, it was my first attempt with no prior knowledge.
